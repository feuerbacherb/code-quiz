## Start the quiz
* When the start button is pressed
  * Start a timer
  * Start posting questions and answers
    * Randomize the questions
  * If I answer wrong, subtract 10 seconds from the clock

## When all the questions are answered or the timer equals zero
* The game is over
  * If the new score is less that the stored score, do not display the Save button, only Try Again and Cancel
    * Have the Try Again and Cancel buttons go back to the first screen
  * On Save, display a form that allows the user to type in their initials
    * Save initials and score to local browser
    * Go back to initial screen
